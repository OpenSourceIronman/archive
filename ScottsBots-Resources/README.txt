These are some of the download and installation resources you will need for using the code in this project.

I have also updated the paths since my book is in print. There's no linux or win32 directories, rather they are organized by function.

The resources include:

- /comm - Java Communications API for Windows & Linux.
- /vision - Java Media Framework for Windows & Linux, plus custom Linux libraries.
- /speech - Free TTS & Sphinx4 libraries, plus information on Quadmore and Microsoft SAPI.

Additional Items needed:

- Java (Search on “Java SDK” or find the install package for your OS.)
- JRuby (http://www.jruby.org/download) 
- Install the Eclipse IDE (http://www.eclipse.org) 
- Install the Subversion plugin to Eclipse Update Site (http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x)  via help -> Install New Software...
- Install the Arduino programmer (http://arduino.cc) (if you have an Arduino.)
- Install the BASIC Stamp programmer (http://www.parallax.com)  (If you have a BASIC Stamp.)
