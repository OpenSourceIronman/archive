#Just Some Example Code

## websocket

This is a simple example that shows normal JS WebSocket with a NodeJS socket server. 

I've created this because I want to invoke websockets form browsers running from within normal web pages to connect to node socket servers. There were no examples that did this, so I created one.

###To run server:

```bash
npm install 
node server.js
```

###To run client:

open client.html in your browser
